- **Night Vision Friendly**: Reduced blue light emission and optimized color palette

### Color System
- **Danger/Emergency**: Red (#EF4444) - Used for SOS buttons and high-risk areas
- **Safe/Secure**: Green (#10B981) - Indicates safe routes and positive safety metrics
- **Caution/Warning**: Amber (#F59E0B) - Medium-risk areas and important notifications
- **Primary Actions**: Blue (#3B82F6) - Main interactive elements and navigation
- **Background**: Dark slate (#0F172A) - Primary background for night visibility

## üîí Safety & Privacy

SafeRoute prioritizes user safety and privacy:

- **Location Data**: Only shared with explicitly chosen emergency contacts
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Safety reports can be submitted anonymously
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only essential safety-related data is collected
- **User Control**: Complete control over data sharing and privacy settings
